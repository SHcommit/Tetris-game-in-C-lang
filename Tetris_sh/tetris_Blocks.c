/**
* blocks.h과 소스파일은 테트리스의 7가지 블록에 대해서 회전할 수 있는 4가지 경우를 4차원 배열로 표현했습니다.
* Blocks 배열
*	- 첫번째 index [BlockType]에 따라서 블록의 형태를 지정할 수 있습니다.
*	- 두번째 index [BlockRotate] 에 따라서 블록이 회전할수 있는 4가지 형태를 지정할 수 있습니다.
*	- 3번째, 4번째 인덱스(4*4) 형태를 출력하면 원하는 블록으 형태를 얻을 수 있습니다.
*
* 숫자 0은 공백
* 숫자 2는 도형을 나타냅니다.
*	-> 이때 블록의 표현을 숫자 2로 한 이유는 테트리스 보드가 표현되는 부분이 숫자 1로 정해서, 이 둘을 쉽게 구분하기 위해서
*		숫자 2로 정의했습니다.
*
* 도형으로 출력을 나타내는 방법은 아래 링크 고고~
